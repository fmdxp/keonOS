# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
I prioritize security updates for the latest development milestones.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2x    | ✅ Active          |
| < 0.2   | ❌ Deprecated      |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
The integrity of the **keonOS** kernel is my primary goal. If you discover a security vulnerability (such as memory corruption, VFS escapes, or CPU state leaks), please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability in a public Issue.
2. Please contact me directly through GitHub (or via a private security advisory).
3. Provide a detailed report and, if possible, a Proof of Concept (PoC).

I aim to acknowledge all reports within 48 hours and provide a fix as soon as possible.
